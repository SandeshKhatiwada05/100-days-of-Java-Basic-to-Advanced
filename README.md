# Java 100 Days Challenge

Welcome to my **Java 100 Days Challenge**!  
In this repository, I’ll be uploading daily Java lessons and programs as I teach students — covering everything from **basic to advanced**, including **core concepts, OOP, Swing, JDBC**, and more.  
Follow along to learn Java step by step!

## Challenge Goal

To teach and reinforce the fundamentals of **Java programming** over the course of **100 days**, starting from the basics like data types and input/output, and gradually progressing to advanced topics such as **OOP, databases, and GUI development**.  
This challenge is designed to help my students (and anyone following along) build a strong foundation in Java through consistent daily practice.
